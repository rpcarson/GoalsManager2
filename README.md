# GoalsManager2


This is a simple app that when completed will allow a user to manage a list of shorterm and longterm goals, and view a list of completed ones. It is a new version of my original goal manager idea which eventually grew much larger than I anticipated.

It will incorporate tableviews, textField/Views, pickerviews, calendar popups, and either nscoding or coreData for data persistence. 

This app builds on the modeling ideas I came up with while working on the first version. I was able to consolidate and streamline alot of the basic functonailty leading to more resuable and readable code.
